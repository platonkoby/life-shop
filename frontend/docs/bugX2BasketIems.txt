when adding a new basket item, the amount given is 1 as needed

however when the user is trying to increase or decrese the amount of existing item
in the basket, it ±2 instead of ±1

how the basket item's amount is morphed:

    1) The +/- buttons in the ux is pressed

    2) The click runs function updateBasketItemsMinus/updateBasketItemsPlus and passes in
    item which was pressed in as a parameter

    3) basketItems array is checked to have the item which was clicked

    With updateBasketItemsPlus:

    4) if basketItems array finds the clicked item, it runs dispatch type increase and passes in
    the clicked item

    5) is basketReducer function, the basketItem array is mapped to increase the amount for the chosen item by 1,
    and returned


    checks:

    - check the amount on every single stage
        1) when ShopItem.txs receives, already increased by 2
        2) 
    - increase the amount of starting items in the shop, to see if it affects the result
